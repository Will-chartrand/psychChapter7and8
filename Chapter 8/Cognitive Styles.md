A *cognitive style* is a person's preferred method of performing cognitive tasks. People differ in the way they perceive information and how they organize information for both present and future use.

One dimension of cognitive style that has been well investigated is *field dependence and field independence* (Witkin et al,. 1954)
- Field-dependence and field independence are consistent traits; that is, people use these styles regardless of the situation and they use them consistently throughout the life span.

Field-independent people tend to perceive object or situations from an internal base - independent of the environment in which the information is being presented.
- See the trees, not the forest

- Field-independent people prefer impersonal situations and require large amounts of interpersonal space.
	-  They prefer solitude, are individualistic, never feel like embracing the whole world, value cognitive pursuits over humanitarian pursuits, and are more concerned with ideas than with people.

- Field-dependent people rely heavily on environmental cues to analyze stimuli
	- see the forest, not the trees
	- Field-dependent people are especially alert to social cues and they prefer the emotional and physical closeness with others. They are sociable, gregarious, like being with others, want to help others, know many people, and are known to many people.

Maybe you're prone to listening to both sides of the argument before you make your own view. This would be as opposed to someone who likes feeling confident in their answer even though they may be wrong.
