#### Is the brain a digital computer?

- Is the mind a computer program?
- Can the operations of the brain be simulated on a digital computer?

[[Descartes]] distinguished between Mind and Matter through the concept of [[Dualism]]

[[Brain]] - the physical organ - composed of neurons (86 billion neurons with 100 trillion connections)
Mind (from Webster's Dictionary):
1. The element or complex of elements in an individual that feels, perceives, thinks, wills, and especially reasons
2. The conscious mental events and capabilities in an organism
3. The organized conscious and unconscious adaptive mental activity of an organism

"The mind is to the brain as the program is to the hardware"

**Serial vs. Parallel Processing**
- Serial processing - a series of steps in the "program" where each step has to be resolved in order for the program to move on to the next step 
- Parallel processing - multiple steps can be processed at the same time - a network of processors that are interconnected (therefore can communicate with each other) - similarly, an interconnected network of neurons (i.e. a Neural Net)


**Can we simulate the operations of the brain on a computer?**

Algorithm - A finite set of well-defined instructions for accomplishing some task

Alan Turing (1936) proposed a hypothetical machine (a Turing Machine) that would follow an algorithm and be able to simulate the logic of any computer that could be constructed (including the brain)

The Church-Turing Thesis (Church's Thesis)
- anything that can be given a precise enough characterization as a set of steps can be simulated on a digital computer

Searle (1980) - the Chinese Room Argument
Essentially, and elaborate Turing Machine 

Thus, the answer is "yes" - we can fool a real person into thinking they are having a conversation with another real person
Note - syntax, not semantics. The computer may be able to generate a valid response for conversation, but it would not understand the meaning of the conversation


**Is the mind a computer program?**

General consensus is that "No" (syntax, not semantics)

Proponents of "Weak AI" - the principle value of the computer in the study of the mind is that it gives us a very powerful tool - it enables us to formulate and test hypotheses in a more rigorous and precise fashion

Proponents of "Strong AI" - the computer is not merely a tool in the study of the mind, rather, the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in teh sense that computers are given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.

**Is the brain a digital computer?**

The answer appears to be a tentative "Yes"
- NOTE - Searle (and others) would claim that the brain is a digital computer, however, the brain is also more than a digital computer - in that it has something more than what a digital computer does - intentionality.
- Limited by the speed of action potentia (actual computers process faster, but work slower).
- The brain is made up of a Neural Net (a web of neurons) that appears to function as a parallel processor.

#### Textbook mnemonics

All the multilingual countries 
- Finish the sweaty ball man
- Finland south africa sweden belgium afghanistan
- finnish sa swede bel m(an)

Cognition is like the ignition. It's the *process* of acquiring knowledge much like turning the key is the process to acquiring miles

Baars (1986) wrote a book on the cognitive revolution
- 86 cognitive revolutions were drinking in bars

Language consists of symbols that we put together with rules
- LAN is the local stuff, so we're en-gauging the smaller pieces to form bigger meanings

Phonemes are like the smallest speech units that can be distinguished perceptually
English has 40, with it's 26 letters and variations of those letters (why the hell does c make that sound we have k for that geez wiz)
- Pho noodles are the small things that make up the soup. Life is soup. I am fork. Life does NOT make sense

Morphemes are the smallest units of meaning in a Language
- much like phonemes but morphemes make sense because it makes sense to do morphine

Language development in children
- 1 to 5 is no surprise
- 10 from 6, they try to say shit
- 13 from 10, they know words like hen
- 12 to 18 is single words they are stating
- 18 to 24 they just want to learn more
- 2 years 2 sentence stage
- 3 they can fully tell their parents when their pants are going to have pee

The critical period is the best time for certain capacities to emerge
- cr1tikal - WOOH! YEAH BABY! This is what we've been waiting for! it's what it's all about!
