Language is a form of communication, whether spoken, written, or signed, that is based on a symbol of symbols. 
All human languages have some common characteristics:
- Infinite generativity is the ability to produce an endless number of meaningful sentences using a finite set of words and rules. 
- Making language is a highly creative process.
- Language is characterized by organizational rules.


**Lanugage Acquisition**

Behaviourist Theories
- Language learned through imitation and reinforcement (i.e. conditioning)
	- This cannot be only how it happens because of infinite generativity - people who speak the language are expected to create *new* sentences that they haven't heard before
- Problem
	- Children create novel words and sentences
	- They overgeneralize language rules - an indication that they are learning the *language rules* instead of merely imitating language

Nativist Theories
- Children have an innate ability to learn language 
- A built-in language acquisition device (not an actual device, just an innate ability)
- An innate sensitivity to the "phonemes" of language and to language rules (syntax)

Interactionist Theories
- Combine both approaches
- Children are biologically prepared to learn language and they also imitate and response to reinforcement from parents

Three types of Interactionist approaches:
1. Cognitive - language development is just an aspect of the natural cognitive development that comes with the child's growth/maturity
2. Social Communication - Language develops because we are social animals and communication is vital to our social world (a functional approach)
3. Emergentist - The young brain is still maturing/forming and the connections are still emerging.  As the child is exposed to language and has a chance to try language, their brain will solidify (consolidate) connections that support this development


Psychologists have debated whether language is independent on thought, or whether thought is dependent on language.
- Language plays a role in cognition by saving into memory not only sounds and images but *also* words. Words, in turn, can influence how we think.
- Cognition may provide an important foundation for language, but its pairing with language is not an automatic process.

Is language unique to humans? Animals can communicate with eachother in various ways, like ants sending chemical signals and whatnot, but are they able to organize and communicate complex concepts?
Some researchers believe apes can learn human language.
For example, there was a chimp named Washoe who had learned american sign language and they had a vocabulary of 160 words.
