Concept formation - understanding the development of concepts in humans is done by observing the development of concepts in children as well as primates and other animals.
Is the use of "concepts" unique to our "larger brains"?

Structure of formation 
- Classical model
	- All instances of a concept share defining properties
	- Ex. When you think of a grocery store you think of a place with food, shopping carts, isles, etc.
- Prototype model
	- People decide on whether an item reflects a concept by comparing it with the most typical item(s) of that concept.
	- Ex. creating some sort of standard average grocery store through combining all of the grocery stores you've been to in order to use as your prototype, then compare the new grocery store you're going to with the prototype to determine if it's really a grocery store or not.

A good example of the difference between the classical and prototype models would be a chair. When you think of a chair, how would you define it?
Maybe something like an object that has four legs, a back, a place to put your ass, etc.
But then you come across a spinny chair. A spinny chair doesn't have four legs, does it? idiot? That's what I thought. What about a rocking chair? Stool? 
Depending on what your prototype of a chair is, some of these things may fit into it and some may not. That just how she goes.
