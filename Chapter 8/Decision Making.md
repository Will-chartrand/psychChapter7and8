Decision making involves evaluating alternatives and making choices among them. 
Generally people use established rules to draw conclusions among them.

Biases and flawed heuristics can interfere with good decision making.
heuristics - they're the kinda rules that help us come to conclusions quicker

- Confirmation Bias - the tendency to search for and use information that supports ideas rather than refutes them
- Belief Perseverance - the tendency to hold onto a belief in the face of contradictory evidence
- Overconfidence Bias - the tendency of people to have more confidence in judgments and decisions than is appropriate based on probability or past experiences.
- Hindsight Bias - the tendency of people after an event has occurred, to believe that they accurately predicted the event

The Availability Heuristic, which can produce flawed thinking, involves making a judgment about the probability of an event based on how readily previous examples come to mind - this is biased thinking due to the fact that the vividness or emotional impact of previous occurrences can impact our recall (thus, making emotional events seem more common than they really are).
Ex. People feeling like airplane crashes are more common because  when it DOES happen it get's a lot of media coverage and stuff and it's really tragic.

The Representativeness Heuristic  - holds that people sometimes make a faulty decision based on how well something matches a prototype rather than it's relevance to a particular situation
