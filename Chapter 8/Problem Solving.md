The use of concepts is central to our ability to solve problems 
Thus, the way we think about, and frame, the world around us influences how we approach and interact with that world.

We can think about stable individual differences in the way we frame and approach the world - personality differences in how we approach problems in our environment 

**Problem Solving Strategies (types)**

Sorrentino & Short (1986)
Theory of Uncertainty Orientation
- Uncertainty Oriented People - have a need to know and to find out new things about the self and the world around them. In situations that involve uncertainty, they are motivated to resolve this uncertainty.
- Certainty Oriented People - typically avoid situations that make uncertainty salient. They prefer situations where there is nothing new to be found out about the self or the world. They have a desire to maintain clarity and gravitate toward certainty. 


Is problem solving unique to humans?
Kohler (1920s) studied chimpanzee ability to use tools and solve problems.
Prior to Kohler's work, it was believed that only humans had the ability to make and use tools.

Kohler demonstrated that chimps could make and use tools. This ability was also noted by Jane Goodall in her observations of chimpanzees in the wild.
