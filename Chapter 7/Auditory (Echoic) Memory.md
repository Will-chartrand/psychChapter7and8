Another form of sensory memory. 
Holds a brief auditory echo of a sound that has just been perceived.
Less than one second worth of "memory capacity"

The purpose it to maintain the stimulus long enough for it to be encoded into [[Short-Term Memory]].

 The info that is being held within our Sensory Memory appears to be UNprocessed.
 
 If the info is not processed, and is not therefore translated into our short-term memory, it only lasts for a short period of time.
 - Iconic up to 0.25 seconds,
 - Echoic up to 1 second
