The Study of memory falls within the realm of [[Cognitive Psychology]], and to some extent, also within [[Physiological Psychology]].

So what is memory?

> Information $\Rightarrow$ Encoding $\Rightarrow$ Storage $\Rightarrow$ Retrieval $\Rightarrow$ Remembering information 

Memory is the way in which we record the past for future reference so that it may affect the present.

In order to remember, one must first have been exposed to a stimulus or event and therefore must have learned

The cognitive process of memory is split into three stages - as shown above, they are [[Encoding]], [[Storage]], and [[Retrieval]].

The Time-Course of Memory

There are three forms of memory - they are different by the length of time that info is stored in each form:
- [[Sensory memory]] 
- [[Short-Term Memory]]
- [[Long-Term Memory]]
