A guy who asked the questions:
- How long does [[Sensory memory]] last?
- How much info gets into sensory memory?

Sperling's *Whole* Report Procedure

- In Sperling's Whole Report Procedure, we are testing [[Visual (Iconic) Memory]].
	- When we're exposed to a visual stimulus, how much of the visual field gets recorded into our sensory memory?
		Everything? Or just the parts that we directly focus on?
		
In this experiment, three rows of three letters are flashed on a screen for a second, and then we record how many letters we can remember.
The experiment found that most people only get one row, and it's usually the top.

So what's happening? What can't we remember all the letters?
- Are we only able to "see" the letters that we can initially "name"?
- OR, do we initially see all of the letters, but this iconic memory fades before we can apply a name to each letter?

Sperling (mad lad) Followed up with another test to determine which of the above is true.


Sperling's Partial Report Procedure

In this next experiment, Sperling trained his participants to memorize three different tones (high, middle and low pitched tone)
Participants were then exposed to similar grids of letters, As the grid disappears, they hear one of the three tones, The tone signals which line they're supposed to recall.
High = top
Middle = middle
Low = bottom


Typically, participants were now able to remember the associated row.
Sperling's Partial Report Procedure shows us that essentially all of the visual field is entering into our Iconic Sensory Memory.
But it is then quickly fading. If we don't focus our attention on it and transfer it into our Short-Term memory,
then it will fade and be lost.
