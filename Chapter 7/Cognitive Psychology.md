#psychology 

The type of psychology which studies the nature and function of information processing - how memory works.

- Researchers in this field seek to explain behaviour by investigating mental processes and structures that cannot be observes directly. As in:
	- Attention
	- Learning
	- Problem Solving
	- Memory
	- Language
	- etc.
- The term "cognition" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used. It is concerned with these processes even when they operate without any relevant stimulation, as in images and hallucinations.

- The research involves many different methods:
	- Neuropsychological analyses of patients with brain damage and mental disorders
	- Computational modelling
	- Functional neuroimaging
	- Experiments on the relation between brain development and cognition in human infants and other vertebrate species
- Also involves theoretical work involving computer simulation of the brain/mind

**Thinking**
- Manipulating information (forming concepts, solving problems, making decisions)

**Concepts**
- Mental categories
- Functional for simplifying & organizing the world around us
- Adaptive for survival (facilitates quick responding)
- Semantic memory (recall of info is semantic - organized by concepts - more efficient)
- Guide behaviours (our concepts influence the way we perceive and interpret the world around us - thus, determining how we will respond and interact)
