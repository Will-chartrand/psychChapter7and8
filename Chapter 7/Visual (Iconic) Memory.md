A form of sensory memory.
Holds a brief visual image of a scene that has just been perceived.

Purpose:
- To maintain the stimulus long enough for it to be encoded into [[Short-Term Memory]].

[[Sperling]] - asked the following questions:
- How long does [[Sensory memory]] last?
- How much info gets into sensory memory?

The sensory memory is fading while you are trying to commit the information to short-term memory.

It would be easier for a "single" icon (something that we can quickly name - and use the "name" that we give the icon to aid our memory)

Here is an example:
Using a more complex visual stimulus, and notice how quickly you are able to name it and thereby move that complex visual stimulus into your
short-term memory.
