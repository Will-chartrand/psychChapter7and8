Information from sensory memory enters short-term memory - in order to maintain info within our short-term memory, we need to engage in [[rehearsal]]

This rehearsal required the use of our [[Long-Term Memory]] - we need to be able to name the items that are being rehearsed
therefore we need to recall the names.

In order to maintain information in short-term memory, we engage in rehearsal. This involves the retrieval of the "sounds" of the letters from out [[Long-Term Memory]].


The storage capacity of short-term memory is markedly different from that of long-term.

One way to determine the capacity of short-term memory storage is to measure the *memory span*, the number of items an individual can recall after just one presentation.

The average ("magic number") seems to be 7 $\pm$ 2
Or some evidence it may be 4 $\pm$ 1

The magic number represents the limits of what we can store (on average) in our [[Working Memory]]
Seven "items" (letters, numbers, words, tones) plus or minus 2
If we try to retain more, then we end up losing some of the information.

 Primacy and Recency:
 Primacy effect - the tendency to remember initial information. 
Recency effect - the tendency to remember later information.

The ability of your working memory to maintain this information (for recall) is dependent on:
- The number of items that you're trying to retain
- Your undivided attention
- Chunking - Ability to chunk information into larger groups

Some theorists believe that each of the five senses most likely has its own form of working memory.
- Currently, we have evidence that there is a verbal working memory and a visual working memory.

A big name in research on working memory is Alan Baddeley.
He stated that memory has four components:
- Phonological Loop - Briefly stores the "sounds" of language
- Visuo-spatial Sketch Pad - Stores a visual, or spatial, representation of the item(s)
- Episodic Buffer - A limited memory storage (buffer) that provides room for the various parts of working memory 
	to integrate information with each other, and also with info from [[Long-Term Memory]]
- Central Executive - The "processor" that focuses our attention (controlling what we are thinking about in our working memory) and coordinates the actions of the other three components
	Our active attention
	
Shepard and Metzler - Provided evidence for a visual working memory system (visuo-spatial sketch pad)

They did an experiment where they showed two 3D-drawn objects on a piece of paper, some of which were rotated differently, and the participant had to say whether they were the same shape or not.

The takeaway point is that the working memory works very similarly to if we actually had a sketch-pad that we could work with.


#### How Short Is Short-Term Memory?

What causes information in STM to disappear?
- Does info in STM decay over time?
- Or, does info in STM get displaced by new info that replaces it (because STM has a limited capacity)?

Test - a series of numbers that will end with a "specific number", our task is to recall the number that occurred immediately after the previous occurrence of that number.
(did the test in the presentation)
- Speed of presentation matters less (decay)
- The number of items between the "cue" and the target affects recall
- Indicating that new info displaces old info in working memory
