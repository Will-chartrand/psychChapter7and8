Sensory memory is Sub- or Un-conscious.

The physical features of the stimulus are stored for a very brief time (less than a second)

A fairly accurate representation of the stimulus.

Function:
- To retain the stimulus long enough for it to be encoded in short-term memory.
- So you grab the environmental stimulus for just a second to be able to focus your attention on it.
- Definitely not a thing that you do consciously

[[Auditory (Echoic) Memory]] and[[ Visual (Iconic) Memory]] are the most studied forms of sensory memory.
