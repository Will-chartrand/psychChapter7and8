Long-Term Memory 
- Explicit Memory (Declarative Memory)
	- Episodic Memory
	- Semantic Memory
- Implicit Memory (Nondeclarative memory)
	- Procedural Memory 
	- Priming 
	- Classical Conditioning

Info in Long-Term Memory is relatively stable.
Consolidation - The process by which info in [[Short-Term Memory]] is transferred to long-term memory.

#### Consolidation

[[Short-Term Memory]] -A temporary pattern of neural activity encoding the info received from the sense organs.
Info in STM is rehearsed, thereby perpetuating the neural activity.
With enough rehearsal, the neural activity causes structural changes in the brain (the info is "consolidated" in the brain).

Even with [[rehearsal]], not all STMs become LTMs.
Maintenance Rehearsal - Rote repitition (repeating without understanding)
Elaborative Rehearsal - Forming associations between new material and old material recalled from LTM (i.e. Deep Processing)
	- Can you remember EGBDF?
	
<br>

Levels of Processing:

Shallow Processing - Analysis of surface features lead to lower number of words recalled.
Deep Processing - Analysis of semantic features (meaning).


Craik & Tulving (1975) did lots of work on testing the effectiveness of elaboration on memory.

Participants read a series of sentences (one at a time) and were then given a word (flashed on a screen) - the task was to determine if the word made sense within the sentence.
Participants were NOT told that this was a memory study, hence the participants were not aware that they needed to remember any of these words.

Two types of sentences were used:
- Simple:
	- We cooked the \_\_\__
	- She dropped the \_\_\__
- Complex:
	- The great bird swooped down and carried off the struggling \_\_\__
	- The old man hobbled across the room and picked up the valuable \_\_\__

After the sentence task, participants were then asked to try and recall the words.
Recall was better for the words that had fit into more complex sentence than for words that had fit into a simple sentence.

This demonstrates that memory is more effectively established if the memory is elaborated upon (deep processing).

<br>

Explicit or Declarative memory
- is an intentional, or conscious use of memory, we are intentionally trying to remember something.
- Includes
	- Episodic Memory 
	- Semantic Memory 

Episodic memory - Memories about specific events (meaningful personal events)
Semantic memory - Conceptual information (remembering specific facts and general ideas about various concepts)

Sachs (1967) demonstrated that the material we read quickly turns into semantic memory.

|                   | Episodic Memory        | Semantic Memory        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Units             | Events, Episods        | Facts, Ideas, Concepts |
| Emotion           | More Important         | Less Important         |
| Retrieval Process | Deliberate (effortful) | Automatic              |
| Retrieval Report  | "I remember"           | "I know"               |


#### Sachs (1967)

Examining whether memory of verbal material is episodic or semantic.
Test - Delay (in \# of syllables) between a test sentence and a comparison sentence (either with different meaning or with same meaning but different word order)
Recall -detecting changes

Results:
When no delay - participants were equally likely to detect both "meaning" and "word-order" changes.
With delay - Participants could still easily detect changes in meaning, but had difficulty detecting changes in word-order (when meaning was the same)

This means the memory is being stores semantically, not episodically.


#### Long-Term Memory 

Implicit or Nondeclarative Memory 
Un- or sub-conscious memory activation
- Procedural memory - remembering skills (i.e. riding a bike)
- Priming - an automatic process where info is memory storage is activated automatically (i.e. [[Stroop Effect| Stroop Task]])
- Classical Conditioning - Automatically learning (and remembering) relations between two stimuli 

In the stroop task:
- "Reading" the words consists of an automatic recall of the semantics of each word.
- Difficult to suppress this effect.


#### LTM Disruptions: Amnesia

Retrograde amnesia - Loss of ability to retrieve memories.
- Story: Football players (remembers stuff immediately after the incident, can't a couple days after in the hospital (trying to recall play number of football game))
	- Suggests that the problem may be in the process of consolidation, rather than a failure to encode,
- Story: Motorcycle accident (can't recall anything)
	- Retrograde amnesia typically "shrinks"
	- Suggesting that the problem may be retrieval, rather than consolidation

Anterograde amnesia - an inability to form new long-term memories.

Quite often, sensory memory and short-term memory are fine, and some patients may also demonstrate the ability to learn new skills.

Suggesting that most anterograde amnesia disrupts the formation of new explicit memories, but not the ability to form new implicit (unconscious)  memories.


#### Is Recall Always Perfect?

Our legal system makes use of eyewitness testimony - but eyewitnesses are relying on their memory.
Can we recall the details of a crime scene?
Can we identify the suspect from a lineup?
Can our recall be influenced by "leading questions"?

How Persuasive Is Eyewitness Testimony?

Elizabeth Loftus - studied this kind of stuff.
Murder case 1: circumstantial evidence and no eyewitness testimony
- 18% voted for conviction

Murder case 2: same evidence but with a single eyewitness 
- 72% voted for conviction

Murder case 3: same evidence & witness, but now the witness is discredited (20/400 vision and not wearing glasses at the time)
- 68% voted for conviction

<br>

Both correct & incorrect witnesses are believed 80% of the time.
This holds true (62%) even when conditions are SO poor that 2/3 of witnesses had actually misidentified an innocent person.

What about witnesses who can remember all of the "fine details"?
- Generally perceived as more accurate by the jury
- Generally not as accurate

So how accurate are those eyewitnesses?

- Robert Buckhout stages an "assault" on a professor
- 141 students were witnesses.
- Students were called in to identify the assailant from a group of 6 photographs
- 60% chose an innocent person

What happens if the eyewitness is "confident"?
Some people are naturally more confident about their decisions.
Jurors tend to believe witnesses who appear more confident in their recollections (but this is only marginally related to accuracy)

Back to Loftus:
She did work on demonstrating the effect of "leading questions" - called the Misinformation Effect.
Important details could be altered in the witness's memory - inserted details and altered details.

Showing participants a picture of a car stopped at a yield sign but saying "stop sign" when asking about the photo. The participants had a stop sign inserted into their memory even though there wasn't one.

Showing two groups of participants a video of cars colliding and then asking one group "How fast were the cars going when they contacted each other?"
and another group "how fast were the cars going when they smashed each other?". 

Changing one word gave an average change in answers between the two groups.


#### False Memories

Ceci & Bruck

Demonstrated children's suggestibility by asking children once a week (for 10 weeks) to,
- "Think real hard, and tell me if this ever happened to you..."
- "...Can you remember going to the hospital with the mousetrap on your finger?"

Follow up interview: 58% of the children could produce false and often detailed stories about the fictional event.
Even when told that the story never really happened, some were completely convinced that it really did.

 
Retelling:
- Commits people to their recollections (accurate or not), accurate retelling helps people to resist misleading suggestions

Police Interviews:
- Used to contain focused/direct questions, but these "leading questions" could create a Misinformation Effect.
- Interviews are now open-ended

Loftus: eyewitness testimony
Support for the idea that episodic memory is more efficiently storedd through the use of mental heuristics (storing a few important details and using our expectations of the other details of the situation to fill in the rest of the details).


#### Remembering & Interference

It used to be believed that some memories were difficult to retrieve due to decay.
Retroactive Interference - new info that is more recent, interferes with our ability to recall earlier info.

 The average number of nonsense syllables recalled after a certain period of time asleep or awake (graph in presentation).
 Being awake, we are encoding new memories that are interfering with our ability to remember the list of nonsense syllables.
 
 This is evidence of a retroactive interference.
 
 Proactive Interference - Ability to recall info is disrupted (same as retroactive) - but here, our ability to recall new info is reduced due to info that we learned previously.
